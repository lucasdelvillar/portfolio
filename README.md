## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The focus was on making a simple UI and smooth UX. 

## Optimizations / Modifications

In terms of optimization, I could have cached my assests and compressed my images as with other websites. I would like to make my website more interactive. Something out of the ordinary that catches the users attentions and makes them feel "wow'd".

## Lessons Learned:

Adding css animations instead of custom javascript when hovering over an element is much easier.
